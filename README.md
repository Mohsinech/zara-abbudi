### **Customizations**

#### **1. Tailwind CSS Configuration**

Update your colors, fonts, and more in the **Tailwind configuration file**:

- File: `tailwind.config.js`
- Example:
  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    theme: {
      extend: {
        colors: {
          dark: "#171717",
          whitegrey: "#F1F1F1",
        },
        fontFamily: {
          sans: ["Neue Montreal", "sans-serif"],
        },
      },
    },
  };
  ```

#### **2. Content Editing**

Edit sections in the `/app` folder:

- **Homepage**: `/page.jsx`

#### **3. GSAP Animations**

Animation logic resides in `/components/ui animation`. Tweak or create new effects as needed:

```javascript
gsap.from(".hero-title", { opacity: 0, y: -50, duration: 1 });
```

#### **4. Component Customization**

Reusable components are stored in `/components`. Modify these to update site-wide elements:

- **Header**: `/components/layouts/Header.jsx`
- **Footer**: `/components/layouts/Footer.jsx`

#### **5. Showcase Customization**

You can showcase your work by:

1. Replacing placeholder images in the `/assets/templates/` folder.
2. Change project data inside `/constants/data.js` file.
   Example:
   ```javascript
   export const Projects = [
     { img: "/assets/templates/tm-1.jpeg", href: "#tm-1" },
     { img: "/assets/templates/tm-2.jpeg", href: "#tm-2" },
     { img: "/assets/templates/tm-3.jpeg", href: "#tm-3" },
     { img: "/assets/templates/tm-4.jpeg", href: "#tm-4" },
     { img: "/assets/templates/tm-5.jpeg", href: "#tm-5" },
   ];
   ```
3. Updating the project details in `/components/layouts/Project.jsx` or equivalent sections.
4. Providing a **preview URL** for your showcased work in the portfolio.  
   Example: Add a ‚ÄúView Work‚Äù button linked to your preview.

### **Deployment**

#### **Deploying on Hostinger (or Other Hosting Platforms)**

If you prefer hosting on **Hostinger** or another platform instead of Vercel:

1. **Build the Project**
   Run the following command to create a production-ready build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will generate an `/out` folder.

2. **Upload to Hosting Platform**

   - Use Hostinger's **File Manager** or an FTP client to upload the contents of the `/out` folder to your server's public directory.
   - Ensure your hosting environment supports static site deployment.

3. **Domain Configuration**
   Set up your domain to point to the hosting platform by updating the DNS records.  
   For more details, check out [Hostinger Deployment Guide](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials).
